## Design Guidelines

### Schematic Standards
- Use standard symbols and conventions
- Clear component labeling
- Logical signal flow (left to right)
- Proper power and ground symbols
- Include component values

### PCB Design Rules
- Minimum trace width: 0.3mm (12 mil)
- Power traces: 1.0mm+ (40 mil+)
- Via size: 0.6mm (24 mil)
- Component spacing: Allow for hand soldering
- Ground plane for noise reduction

## Contributing Schematics
